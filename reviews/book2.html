         reluctantly accepts an invitation from a millionaire to act as a guide to time-travelling tourists.

         where dark and dangerous forces know about the gates in time.</p></div>

      <div class="second">
      <p>Caught up in the intrigue between rival bands of beggars, pursued by Egyptian sorcerers, and befriended 
        by Coleridge, Doyle somehow survives and learns more about the mysterious Ashbless than he could ever have
         imagined possible...</p></div>
