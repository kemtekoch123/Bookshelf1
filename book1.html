    <div class="first">
    <p>In the early days of the Civil War, rumors of gold in the frozen Klondike brought hordes of
         newcomers to the Pacific Northwest. Anxious to compete, Russian prospectors commissioned
          inventor Leviticus Blue to create a great machine that could mine through Alaska’s ice.
           Thus was Dr. Blue’s Incredible Bone-Shaking Drill Engine born.</p></div>

      <div class="second">
      <p>But on its first test run the Boneshaker went terribly awry, destroying several blocks of 
        downtown Seattle and unearthing a subterranean vein of blight gas that turned anyone who
         breathed it into the living dead.</p></div>

        <div class="third">
      <p>Now it is sixteen years later, and a wall has been built to enclose the devastated and 
        toxic city. Just beyond it lives Blue’s widow, Briar Wilkes. Life is hard with a ruined
         reputation and a teenaged boy to support, but she and Ezekiel are managing. Until Ezekiel
          undertakes a secret crusade to rewrite history.</p></div>
        
          <div class="fourth">
       <p>His quest will take him under the wall and into a city teeming with ravenous undead, 
        air pirates, criminal overlords, and heavily armed refugees. And only Briar can bring him
         out alive.</p></div>
